Article section,Purpose
Abstract,"Summary of the value of the study, the experimental design and the dataset itself."
"Introduction","Outline of the reason for the study. Authors should put into perspective its value for the scientific and broader communities. Often sequencing studies are part of large scale genome sequencing projects and this article section allows authors to explain their role in them".
"Methods","This section is split into 3 major parts (*Sampling*, *Sample processing*, *Data processing*) to describe how the physical material was collected, processed and transformed into a dataset. The *Sampling* section allows authors to outline the environmental and geographic characteristics of the locations where their material was collected. Authors are encouraged to share as much detail as they can (e.g. geographic coordinates, habitats, seasonal information, etc. ). The sampling methods should be described in the *Technologies used* subsection. *Sample processing* should explain the laboratory procedures involved in the transition of the physical sample into its digital footprint. Finally, the *Data Processing* subsection should mention the steps taken to transform the raw dataset into the one which was published (e.g. normalisation steps). None of the subsections are compulsory and the authors can write the Methods in a form outside these topics but our template provides a detailed best practices structure to follow."
"Biodiversity profile","This section describes the experimental design of the study and has 4 subsections: *Target*, *Taxonomic range*, *Functional range*, *Traits*. The target refers to the molecular target being studied (i.e. DNA, RNA, protein). The taxonomic range refers to the taxonomy of the studied organism(s) or the taxonomic composition of a metagenomic sample. The authors are encouraged to use a common taxonomy but they can also provide their own during the authoring process in AWT. Authors can specify a particular range of biological functions which was the subject of their study (e.g. metabolic functions), as well as specific traits (e.g. pathogenicity) if relevant to the study."
Data resources,"This is the section which contains a link to the dataset(s) (preferably to its permanent resolvable identifier, such as a DOI), as well as any accession numbers and data formats."
Data statistics,"Quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. (e.g. read depth, coverage, base ratios). This section helps readers to quickly evaluate the dataset by gauging some of its characteristics without having analysed the dataset themselves. Some of the data statistics can be represented as charts and/or short tables."
Caveats and limitations,"A section to discuss what could be improved in the experiment, what future steps could be taken and what to consider when re-using the published data."
